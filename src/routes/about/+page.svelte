	<p class="m-4 font-medium text-lg">
		Our organization, UTD African Student Union, is comprised of students and staff of the African
		heritage and our supporters. Here we create a community for those away from home where we
		celebrate our unique heritages from across the continent and more and discuss what it means to
		be members of the African diaspora on campus.
	</p>

	<h1 class="lg:mt-20 font-semibold mx-3 text-center text-4xl text-secondary">Our Mission</h1>

	<p class="m-4 font-medium text-lg">
		As we wish to be more involved in the community and to have a greater connection between our
		students and our surrounding areas, we would like to involve you through our journey. Events,
		such as our annual Fall Ball and African Night, are ways for a greater reach and as we expand,
		we ask you to provide services that would benefit both of us and allow your name to reach your
		targeted audiences.
